# search-and-replace

Experiment.
Don't use this.

# TODO

- [ ] Create grammar, similar to markdown so that I can fold and jump by `cmd-r`.
- [ ] Open with adjacent pane
- [ ] Dynamically add grammar matching with search keyword to achieve highlight(using marker make editor slow maybe).
- [ ] update result text start from line3 onDidChange first line.
- [ ] Ignore other line change
- [ ] On save, update corresponding text-buffer.
- [ ] Keep update result-buffer -to- actual-buffer to be translatable
