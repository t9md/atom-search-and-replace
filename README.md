# search-and-replace

Experiment.
Don't use this.

# TODO

- [x] Create grammar, similar to markdown ~~so that I can fold and jump by `cmd-r`~~.
- [x] Open with adjacent pane
- [x] Dynamically add grammar matching with search keyword to achieve highlight(using marker make editor slow maybe).
- [x] update result text start from line3 onDidChange first line.
- [x] Ignore other line change
- [ ] On save, update corresponding text-buffer.
- [x] Keep update result-buffer -to- actual-buffer to be translatable
